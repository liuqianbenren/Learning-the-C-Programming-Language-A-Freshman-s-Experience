# Learning-the-C-Programming-Language-A-Freshman-s-Experience
This is my C language learning notebook. I write down my notes and code here. Sometimes I get help from AI. I hope it can help others too. Please tell me if you find any mistakes.
I'm a beginner, and I would be very grateful if anyone could point out any mistakes to me.
